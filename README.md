ZimSOAP : a programmatic python interface to zimbra
===================================================

ZimSOAP allows to access the [SOAP Zimbra API] through a programmatic interface,
taking care of authentification.

Although Zimbra does not provide a WSDL, ZimSOAP provides its own (partial) one.
